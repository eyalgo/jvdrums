Installing and running the application:
	- You should have a Java jar file called jvdrums.jar
	In windows all you need to do is double click and the application should run.
	The application uses Java 6 so it must be installed BEFORE running the program.
	Another way running it is in the command line run: java -jar jvdrums.jar

	You can check what kind of version and if Java is installed with the command:
	java -version in the command line window.
